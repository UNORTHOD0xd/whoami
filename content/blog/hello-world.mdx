Welcome to my blog! This is where I'll be sharing my thoughts, learnings, and experiences in the world of blockchain security and smart contract development.

## What to Expect

I plan to cover a variety of topics including:

- **Security Writeups**: Deep dives into smart contract vulnerabilities, audit findings, and security best practices
- **Technical Tutorials**: Guides on Solidity development, testing with Foundry, and DeFi protocol analysis
- **CTF Writeups**: Solutions and learnings from blockchain security CTF challenges
- **Building in Public**: Updates on projects I'm working on and lessons learned along the way

## Why Blog?

Writing helps me solidify my understanding of complex topics. By explaining concepts clearly enough for others to understand, I ensure I truly grasp them myself. Plus, I hope these posts can help others on similar journeys in the blockchain security space.
